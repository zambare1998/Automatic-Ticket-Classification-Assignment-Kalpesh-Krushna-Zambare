    "\n",
    "You need to build a model that is able to classify customer complaints based on the products/services. By doing so, you can segregate these tickets into their relevant categories and, therefore, help in the quick resolution of the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be doing topic modelling on the <b>.json</b> data provided by the company. Since this data is not labelled, you need to apply NMF to analyse patterns and classify tickets into the following five clusters based on their products/services:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Credit card / Prepaid card\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bank account services\n",
    "\n",

    "* Mortgages/loans\n",
    "\n",
    "* Others\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With the help of topic modelling, you will be able to map each ticket onto its respective department/category. You can then use this data to train any supervised model such as logistic regression, decision tree or random forest. Using this trained model, you can classify any new customer complaint support ticket into its relevant department."

       "11  On XX/XX/2018, while trying to book a XXXX  XXXX  ticket, I came across an offer for {$300.00} to be applied towards the ticket if I applied for a rewards card. I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.   \n",

       "11  on xx/xx/, while trying to book a xxxx  xxxx  ticket, i came across an offer for {$.} to be applied towards the ticket if i applied for a rewards card. i put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. i immediately contacted xxxx and was referred to chase bank. i then immediately contacted chase bank within no more than  of getting the notification on the screen and i was told by the chase representative i spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. i asked for more information about the xxxx  offer and she explained that even if i had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. i then explicitly told her i was glad i got denied and i was absolutely no longer interested in the account. i asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. this all happened no later than  after putting in the application on xx/xx/. notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what i was told by the chase representative, chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on xx/xx/. this is now being reported in my credit report and chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which i did not consent to and out of their error.   \n",

       "11  on xx/xx/, while trying to book a xxxx  xxxx  ticket, i came across an offer for {$.} to be applied towards the ticket if i applied for a rewards card. i put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. i immediately contacted xxxx and was referred to chase bank. i then immediately contacted chase bank within no more than  of getting the notification on the screen and i was told by the chase representative i spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. i asked for more information about the xxxx  offer and she explained that even if i had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. i then explicitly told her i was glad i got denied and i was absolutely no longer interested in the account. i asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. this all happened no later than  after putting in the application on xx/xx/. notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what i was told by the chase representative, chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on xx/xx/. this is now being reported in my credit report and chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which i did not consent to and out of their error.   \n",

       "11  on xx/xx/, while trying to book a xxxx  xxxx  ticket, i came across an offer for {$.} to be applied towards the ticket if i applied for a rewards card. i put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. i immediately contacted xxxx and was referred to chase bank. i then immediately contacted chase bank within no more than  of getting the notification on the screen and i was told by the chase representative i spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. i asked for more information about the xxxx  offer and she explained that even if i had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. i then explicitly told her i was glad i got denied and i was absolutely no longer interested in the account. i asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. this all happened no later than  after putting in the application on xx/xx/. notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what i was told by the chase representative, chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on xx/xx/. this is now being reported in my credit report and chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which i did not consent to and out of their error.   \n",

       "11  on xx/xx/, while trying to book a xxxx  xxxx  ticket, i came across an offer for {$.} to be applied towards the ticket if i applied for a rewards card. i put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. i immediately contacted xxxx and was referred to chase bank. i then immediately contacted chase bank within no more than  of getting the notification on the screen and i was told by the chase representative i spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. i asked for more information about the xxxx  offer and she explained that even if i had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. i then explicitly told her i was glad i got denied and i was absolutely no longer interested in the account. i asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. this all happened no later than  after putting in the application on xx/xx/. notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what i was told by the chase representative, chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on xx/xx/. this is now being reported in my credit report and chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which i did not consent to and out of their error.   \n",

xx/xx/. on thursday xx/xx/ i went into a branch after being advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed. i went into the branch to see how i can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned. the bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would post but they may take an additional business day. that saturday i attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on friday, xx/xx/. upon looking at my account i realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement. ive been called and i was told that it may take two business day stating tuesday, xx/xx/xxxx would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only. now, chase is informing me that i will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently. unfortunately, this has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments, etc. i am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself. although i know that chase reserves the right to close my account at any time i do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document. i am not being a shored or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that i have peace of mind in fact chase has handled my situation grossly i even had a

bank on xxxx and used a code for xxxx bonus. i called to follow up on xx/xx/xxxx about the terms and was told everything was on the account and once i made xxxx direct deposit the bonus would be paid out in  days. as of xxxx i had made the required deposits and was told my account never had the coupon code applied and it was past the  days to do so, so no bonus would be paid.   \n",

                                                       i opened the saving account for the {$.} bonus. i was supposed to received the {$.} bonus after  consecutive auto transfers from checking to savings. i notice on xx/xx/ that automatic transfer was cancelled for not enough funds into my checking 's account. therefore, i put enough funds in my account on xx/xx/ requested that the executive team reactivate my automatic transfer for the month of xxxx. although ms. xxxx reached out to me from the executive office, she failed to try to resolve my concerns ( case # xxxx ).   \n",

be applied towards the ticket if i applied for a rewards card. i put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. i immediately contacted xxxx and was referred to chase bank. i then immediately contacted chase bank within no more than  of getting the notification on the screen and i was told by the chase representative i spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. i asked for more information about the xxxx  offer and she explained that even if i had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. i then explicitly told her i was glad i got denied and i was absolutely no longer interested in the account. i asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. this all happened no later than  after putting in the application on xx/xx/. notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what i was told by the chase representative, chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on xx/xx/. this is now being reported in my credit report and chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which i did not consent to and out of their error.   \n",

summer months, i experience a decline income due to my employment. therefore, i request a one month payment extension with my auto loan company, chase. for the past almost fours years, my request for payment extension is granted. i have never been delinquent with my auto loan payment. however, on xx/xx/ my request for a one month payment extension was denied this year. i explained my situation to representative and the supervisor with no avail. after a lengthy discussion and waiting, i was informed the reason for the decline as it is not \" contractual ''. this reason for denial baffled me and therefore i emailed the office of xxxx xxxx executive director, communications, jpmorgan chase & co. a representative contacted me and stated chase will follow-up. about week later a representative of xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx office called. the representative shared her role was help resolve the matter. the representative via conference call contacted the department handing my request. after, reviewing my information my request was still denied based on \" policy changes ''. i requested an explanation and representative stated a letter will be mailed with explanation. i have received xxxx letters the reason for denial was not \" policy changes ''. i would like cfpb help in exploring the denial of my payment extension request especially since i have been clear reason for denial.   \n",

xxxx. \\n\\nthey say that i tried to make another payment for {$.} later that same day and in a few days that came back as a return payment. \\n\\nthe man on the phone stated to me that if the payment went through then it would have meant that i had a credit on my account for xxxx since i didnt owe anything. \\n\\nthey updated my account with charges and late fees from the return payment that i had no idea of since i thought i paid off the entire amount. they reported to the credit bureau that i was  days late for not paying what accrued to be {$.} the guy representing chase agreed with me that they were in the wrong for charging me the fees and said they would remove them. i still have {$.} in the negative that they are saying that i owe in the mobile app. \\n\\nadditionally, because they reported me being late my credit score dropped  points. when i called back to ask if they can report that they made a mistake they said i would have to do that on my own. i think that's xxxx.   \n",

payments of {$.} on xx/xx/xxxx and {$.} on xx/xx/xxxx. the minimum payment was {$.}. the closing date was xx/xx/xxxx ( please see attached statement ). that statement ( xx/xx/xxxx ) shows that i had an outstanding purchase balance of {$.} on xx/xx/xxxx. i have enclosed the previous months statement to show that there were no other purchases prior to the one on xx/xx/xxxx. \\nhowever, when i got the xxxx statement, it shows that i still have a purchase balance of {$.}. i have a promotional balance (@xxxx ) in xxxx of {$.}. in xxxx, the promotional balance was {$.} - a difference of {$.}. \\n\\napparently, the payment ( above the minimum payment required by chase ) i thought would be applied to the purchase (@ . % ) was applied to the promotional balance first. it is my understanding that once the minimum payment has been met, payments in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first. this is not the first time that chase has skirted us financial law to turn a larger profit. i need help in rectifying this problem, because my logic fell on deaf ears at chase. thank you in advance for your assistance. \\n\\nrespectfully, xxxx xxxx xxxx

i placed a disputes case with chase bank on xx/xx/ when i noticed the charge on my account. i called back on sunday, xx/xx/ about the provisional credit for the charge and again on monday, xx/xx/. i was told the charge had to post before a provisional credit could be provided. i used my debt card on monday, xx/xx/ then tried to use it again but it would not work. i went to chase bank on xxxx xxxx xxxx in xxxx xxxx, nevada and was told that my account was closed due to fraudulent activity. i was shocked because i had not reported fraud on my account. i later found out that i was being accused by the disputes department of placing a fraudulent disputes case for the duplicate charge from xxxx xxxx  xxxx. i later contacted xxxx xxxx  xxxx again and was told that they did see a duplicate charge and would credit my account within  -   days. i contacted the chase disputes department again on monday, xx/xx/xxxx.  and explained thaxxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx would credit my account and that i did not like being accused of making a fraudulent disputes claim. the escalation manager did not care and told me that chase decision on closing my account was final. i had been a customer of chase for xxxx   years. my character has been challenged by the disputes agents and i consider this to be detrimental to my character and slander. \\n\\ni am not seeking to keep my account open with chase but i also do not want chase reporting that they closed my checking account involuntarily. \\n\\nonce again, i do not want chase to have the checking account that i had with them being reflecting on any public records as being closed as involuntary closure by chase. \\n\\ni did nothing wrong by filing a disputes claim for the duplicate charge or any other disputes cases that were filed in the past.

           to whom it may concern, chase bank charged wrongly overdraft fees, i have alert of low balance or unsuficent fee balance and always deposit immediatly to cover transactions if needed but chase always changed the order and charged me overdraft fee anyway. when you call they said their per their guidelines they don't refund more then  overdrawft doesn't matter bank fault or not.\\n\\ntaken {$.} from people is money just because you can is not ok.\\n\\nsee attached documents. when chase refund, they always find the way to take back what they refunded in first place.

                                  my chase amazon card was declined for a catering order i had placed for my brothers funeral in the amount of {$.}. i contacted chase around noon today xx/xx/ and was asked the last  numbers of my chase savings account and the other user on my account. i responded that i did not have a savings and i am only authorized user. customer rep told me they would call me back in  minutes to keep the line open. i didnt receive a call back after an hour so i contacted chase. from the first call i thought someone was using my card fraudulently. i spoke to the rep who transferred me to a supervisor xxxx who said the card was activated and the transaction would process. called the catering company and card was declined. i then used my xxxx  xxxx card to pay for the order. xxxx xxxx texted me asking if i was authorizing purchase and i responded yes. contacted caterer and xxxx  xxxx was declined. i contacted chase again spoke to rep was told the initial questions are used to trick people to see what there answer would be. she told me the cvv code was incorrectly being input by the caterer and i responded that i had gone over the numbers and cvv used was correct. she told me the card was cleared for the purchase and she would monitor it for  hours. called caterer - card declined. use a mastercard  which processed. went to use chase amazon at restaurant at xxxx pm tonight in the amount of {$.} - it was declined. i was told by chase i was not over limit. still frustrated figuring out multiple declines after several conversations with chase stating the card would be ok to use. embarrassed as the caterer kept suggesting i was over my limit which i pay my card in full every month and chase confirmed that i was under my limit with the {$.} transaction. never been declined by either chase or xxxx  xxxx before - today after multiple assurances that i was all set and card would be monitored to make sure transaction would clear - it never did   \n",

'' that xxxx, my message was reviewed and i received a response restating my original email and informing me that \" the transfer has been completed. however, as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email, some require the expertise of another team. in order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team. '' i called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department. i was directed to call xxxx and ask them about the transaction because chase did not have any information outside of what i provided when initiating the transfer. i felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and i had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and didn't have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask xxxx or what words and phrases i should use to get the information i was looking for. \\n\\ni called xxxx who's automated system initially directed me to call my bank because i used the banks app to initiate the transaction. i called xxxx again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent. they told me that all of the information about the transaction would in chase 's system because i used the banks app to perform the transaction. she stayed on the line with me until i understood everything that i should ask and had a better understanding of the situation. i ended the call and called chase again. \\n\\nwhen i called chase the second time, the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information. she then asked me why i needed this information and i explained my situation again. i was once again transferred to the claims department, who told me that i needed to contact xxxx to get the information i was looking for. after i told her that i had already contacted them, she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured. she said that chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that i inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system. in both phone calls, they asked if i initiated that transaction, and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter. \\n\\nduring this whole process, it felt like chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation. these transactions are advertised as a \" fast, safe and easy way to send money, '' but seem to be a dangerous way to do business. i feel deceived by chase 's advertising and further victimized by the way i was treated by the members on their customer service team.   \n",

                                    chase sent me an email today with the innocuous title \" important information regarding changes to your chase account '' ( they often use similar titles for ads and other communications ). \\n\\nin it, they force me into binding arbitration ( despite that never being something i had agreed to and never being a part of any contract between me and them ). \\n\\nthey do include a method to opt out, but have no additional information about the consequences ( many other people i've seen who have had a similar problem are afraid that chase will close their account if they opt out ) and, even more egregiously, despite chase simply sending an email doing this, they require me to mail them a letter with my personal information enclosed in order to opt out. \\n\\nthis is clearly less secure and a massive loss of both my time and money that is clearly being used solely to dissuade people from opting out. \\n\\nthis is blatant malpractice by chase.   \n",

                                 on xx / xx/ , while try to book a xxxx   xxxx   ticket , I come across an offer for { $ . } to be apply towards the ticket if I apply for a reward card . I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute , be notify via the screen that a decision could not be make . I immediately contact xxxx and be refer to chase bank . I then immediately contact chase bank within no more than   of get the notification on the screen and I be tell by the chase representative I speak with that my application be deny but she could not state why . I ask for more information about the xxxx   offer and she explain that even if I have be approve , the credit offer only gets apply after the first account statement and could not be use to purchase the ticket . I then explicitly tell she I be glad I got deny and I be absolutely no long interested in the account . I ask that the application be withdraw and the representative oblige . this all happen no later than   after put in the application on xx / xx/. notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I be tell by the chase representative , chase do in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on xx / xx/. this be now be report in my credit report and chase have refuse to correct this information on my credit report even though they go ahead to process an application which I do not consent to and out of their error .   \n",

the credit bureau that I be   day late on a payment that be already pay off . when I call I get this info : they show that on the xxxx of xx / xx/ I be very late on my bill and owe xxxx to bring this balance down to xxxx and be finish with the bill . I pay that amount on the same day the xxxx to be it to xxxx . \\n\\n they say that I try to make another payment for { $ . } later that same day and in a few day that come back as a return payment . \\n\\n the man on the phone state to I that if the payment go through then it would have mean that I have a credit on my account for xxxx since I do not owe anything . \\n\\n they update my account with charge and late fee from the return payment that I have no idea of since I think I pay off the entire amount . they report to the credit bureau that I be   day late for not pay what accrue to be { $ . } the guy represent chase agree with I that they be in the wrong for charge I the fee and say they would remove they .

purchase of { $ . } on xx / xx / xxxx . I make payment of { $ . } on xx / xx / xxxx and { $ . } on xx / xx / xxxx . the minimum payment be { $ . } . the closing date be xx / xx / xxxx ( please see attached statement ) . that statement ( xx / xx / xxxx ) show that I have an outstanding purchase balance of { $ . } on xx / xx / xxxx . I have enclose the previous month statement to show that there be no other purchase prior to the one on xx / xx / xxxx . \\n however , when I get the xxxx statement , it show that I still have a purchase balance of { $ . } . I have a promotional balance ( @xxxx ) in xxxx of { $ . } . in xxxx , the promotional balance be { $ . } - a difference of { $ . } . \\n\\n apparently , the payment ( above the minimum payment require by chase ) I think would be apply to the purchase ( @ . % ) be apply to the promotional balance first . it be my understanding that once the minimum payment have be meet , payment in excess of the minimum would be apply to the high interest rate balance first . this be not the first time that chase have skirt we financial law to turn a large profit . I need help in rectify this problem , because my logic fall on deaf ear at chase . thank you in advance for your assistance . \\n\\n respectfully , xxxx xxxx xxxx   \n",

I be charge twice for this transaction . I place a dispute case with chase bank on xx / xx/ when I notice the charge on my account . I call back on sunday , xx / xx/ about the provisional credit for the charge and again on monday , xx / xx/. I be tell the charge have to post before a provisional credit could be provide . I use my debt card on monday , xx / xx/ then try to use it again but it would not work . I go to chase bank on xxxx xxxx xxxx in xxxx xxxx , nevada and be tell that my account be close due to fraudulent activity . I be shocked because I have not report fraud on my account . I later find out that I be be accuse by the dispute department of place a fraudulent dispute case for the duplicate charge from xxxx xxxx   xxxx . I later contact xxxx xxxx   xxxx again and be tell that they do see a duplicate charge and would credit my account within   -    day . I contact the chase dispute department again on monday , xx / xx / xxxx .   and explain thaxxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx would credit my account and that I do not like be accuse of make a fraudulent dispute claim . the escalation manager do not care and tell I that chase decision on close my account be final . I have be a customer of chase for xxxx    year . my character have be challenge by the dispute agent and I consider this to be detrimental to my character and slander . \\n\\n I be not seek to keep my account open with chase but I also do not want chase report that they close my check account involuntarily . \\n\\n once again , I do not want chase to have the checking account that I have with they be reflect on any public record as be close as involuntary closure by chase . \\n\\n I do nothing wrong by file a dispute claim for the duplicate charge or any other dispute case that be file in the past .   \n",

unsuficent fee balance and always deposit immediatly to cover transaction if need but chase always change the order and charge I overdraft fee anyway . when you call they say their per their guideline they do not refund more then   overdrawft do not matter bank fault or not . \\n\\n take { $ . } from people be money just because you can be not ok . \\n\\n see attached document . when chase refund , they always find the way to take back what they refund in first place .   \n",

I realize that this be a scam website after no confirmation , product , or response to any inquiry regard the order and contact chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt get a refund through the retailer bank . \\n\\n I contact chase via a secure message on xx / xx/ explain what happen and ask \" be there a way to reverse this transaction , or do you have a contact at xxxx that can give I more information about the recipient ? '' that xxxx , my message be review and I receive a response restate my original email and inform I that \" the transfer have be complete . however , as you mention that the website be a scam while we can handle most inquiry by email , some require the expertise of another team . in order to assist you well in regard to the refund we request you to call our consumer online technical support team . '' I call the number list in the email and explain my situation to then be transfer to the claim department . I be direct to call xxxx and ask they about the transaction because chase do not have any information outside of what I provide when initiate the transfer . I feel like this agent be try to get I to end the call as quickly as possible and I have to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at xxxx and do not have an opportunity to get any information about what the right question would be to ask xxxx or what word and phrase I should use to get the information I be look for . \\n\\n I call xxxx who be automate system initially direct I to call my bank because I use the bank app to initiate the transaction . I call xxxx again to navigate their menu and talk to a customer service agent . they tell I that all of the information about the transaction would in chase 's system because I use the bank app to perform the transaction . she stay on the line with I until I understand everything that I should ask and have a well understanding of the situation . I end the call and call chase again . \\n\\n when I call chase the second time , the agent try to look up the information about the receive bank but could not find any additional information . she then ask I why I need this information and I explain my situation again . I be once again transfer to the claim department , who tell I that I need to contact xxxx to get the information I be look for . after I tell she that I have already contact they , she finally admit that there be nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these type of transaction be not secure . she say that chase have no information about the recipient other than the email address that I inputte and that the recipient banking information be not keep in the system . in both phone call , they ask if I initiate that transaction , and use that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regard to this matter . \\n\\n during this whole process , it feel like chase be not transparent about their policy regard these type of transaction nor be they helpful in help I get any information about the situation . these transaction be advertise as a \" fast , safe and easy way to send money , '' but seem to be a dangerous way to do business . I feel deceive by chase 's advertising and far victimize by the way I be treat by the member on their customer service team .   \n",

important information regard change to your chase account '' ( they often use similar title for ad and other communication ) . \\n\\n in it , they force I into bind arbitration ( despite that never be something I have agree to and never be a part of any contract between I and they ) . \\n\\n they do include a method to opt out , but have no additional information about the consequence ( many other people I 've see who have have a similar problem be afraid that chase will close their account if they opt out ) and , even more egregiously , despite chase simply send an email do this , they require I to mail they a letter with my personal information enclose in order to opt out . \\n\\n this be clearly less secure and a massive loss of both my time and money that be clearly be use solely to dissuade people from opt out . \\n\\n this be blatant malpractice by chase .   \n",

       "11  on xx/xx/, while trying to book a xxxx  xxxx  ticket, i came across an offer for {$.} to be applied towards the ticket if i applied for a rewards card. i put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. i immediately contacted xxxx and was referred to chase bank. i then immediately contacted chase bank within no more than  of getting the notification on the screen and i was told by the chase representative i spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. i asked for more information about the xxxx  offer and she explained that even if i had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. i then explicitly told her i was glad i got denied and i was absolutely no longer interested in the account. i asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. this all happened no later than  after putting in the application on xx/xx/. notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what i was told by the chase representative, chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on xx/xx/. this is now being reported in my credit report and chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which i did not consent to and out of their error.   \n",

    "1.  **Accuracy**: The overall accuracy of the classifier is approximately 78%. This means that the model correctly classified 78% of the test samples into their respective topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Precision**: Precision measures the ratio of correctly predicted positive cases to the total predicted positive cases. In this case, precision varies for each topic:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * For \"Bank Account services,\" precision is 78%, which means that 78% of the complaints classified as \"Bank Account services\" were correctly classified.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * For \"Credit card or prepaid card,\" precision is 80%.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * For \"Others,\" precision is 66%.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * For \"Theft/Dispute Reporting,\" precision is 77%.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * For \"Mortgage/Loan,\" precision is 83%.\n",

    "3.  **Recall**: Recall measures the ratio of correctly predicted positive cases to the total actual positive cases. In this case, recall varies for each topic:\n",
    "\n",
    "   *  For \"Bank Account services,\" recall is 83%, indicating that 83% of the actual \"Bank Account services\" complaints were correctly identified.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   * For \"Credit card or prepaid card,\" recall is 75%.\n",
    "   *  For \"Others,\" recall is 63%.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **F1-Score**: The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics. The weighted average F1-score for this model is approximately 0.78. This indicates an overall good balance between precision and recall for classifying complaints into their topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Support**: Support represents the number of samples for each class in the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Macro Avg**: The macro-average considers the average precision, recall, and F1-score across all classes, giving each class equal weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Weighted Avg**: The weighted average considers the average precision, recall, and F1-score, weighted by the number of samples in each class. It provides a better representation of the model's overall performance when classes are imbalanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier demonstrates reasonably good performance in classifying complaints into their respective topics. The weighted average F1-score of approximately 0.78 suggests that the model achieves a good balance between precision and recall, considering the imbalanced nature of the classes.\n",

    "* **Precision**: Precision measures how many of the predicted cases were actually correct. In this report, for each topic, we can see the precision values. For example, for \"Bank Account services,\" the precision is 0.95, which means that when the model predicts a complaint belongs to this topic, it is correct 95% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Recall**: Recall measures how many of the actual cases were correctly predicted by the model. It indicates the model's ability to capture all relevant cases. For example, for \"Credit card or prepaid card,\" the recall is 0.95, meaning that the model correctly identifies 95% of the actual complaints in this category.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **F1-Score**: The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics. A higher F1-score indicates a better overall balance between precision and recall. In this report, we can see the F1-scores for each topic, ranging from 0.92 to 0.95, indicating strong performance across all topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Support**: Support represents the number of samples in each class, which is the number of complaints for each topic in the test dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the tuned Logistic Regression model performs exceptionally well, with high precision, recall, and F1-scores across all topics. This indicates that the model is effective in classifying complaints into the correct topics, and it maintains a good balance between precision and recall. The weighted average F1-score of approximately 0.94 demonstrates the overall strong performance of this model in topic classification.\n",

    "We have successfully evaluated the tuned Decision Tree classifier on the test data. This report provides detailed performance metrics for each class (topic) in your dataset, as well as macro and weighted averages across all classes. The Decision Tree classifier appears to perform reasonably well, with F1-scores ranging from 0.74 to 0.83 for different topics. The weighted average F1-score is 0.79, indicating overall good performance in classifying complaints into topics. Here's a summary of the classification report:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  **Precision**: Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions. For each class (topic), it tells us how many of the instances predicted as that class are actually correct. For example, for \"Bank Account services,\" a precision of 0.78 means that 78% of the instances predicted as \"Bank Account services\" were correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Recall**: Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, measures the ability of the classifier to correctly identify all relevant instances in a class. It tells us what percentage of actual instances of a class were correctly predicted. A recall of 0.82 for \"Bank Account services\" means that 82% of actual \"Bank Account services\" instances were correctly identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  **F1-score**: The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It provides a balanced measure that takes into account both false positives and false negatives. It is particularly useful when there is an imbalance between classes or when false positives and false negatives have different consequences. For example, an F1-score of 0.80 for \"Bank Account services\" indicates a good balance between precision and recall for this class.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  **Support**: Support represents the number of actual occurrences of each class in the test dataset. It provides context for the precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  **Accuracy**: Accuracy measures the overall correctness of predictions across all classes. It tells us what percentage of all instances were correctly classified by the model. In this case, the accuracy is 0.79, indicating that approximately 79% of all complaints were correctly classified into their respective topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Macro Avg (average)**: This is the average of precision, recall, and F1-score calculated independently for each class. It provides an unweighted average of the metrics and is useful when all classes are equally important. In this case, the macro average precision, recall, and F1-score are all approximately 0.79.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  **Weighted Avg (average)**: This is a weighted average of precision, recall, and F1-score, where the weights are based on the support of each class. It gives more importance to classes with more instances. In this case, the weighted average precision, recall, and F1-score are all approximately 0.79.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the classification report shows that the tuned Decision Tree classifier is performing reasonably well, with F1-scores ranging from 0.74 to 0.83 for different topics. The weighted average F1-score of 0.79 indicates good overall performance in classifying complaints into their respective topics.\n",

    "# OVERALL CONCLUSION OF ASSIGNMENT\n",
    "\n",
    "* The \"Automatic Ticket Classification\" assignment is a practical application of text classification techniques in the domain of customer support and complaint management. It involves the development of machine learning models to automatically categorize customer complaints into relevant topics or categories. This assignment is particularly relevant in scenarios where organizations receive a large volume of customer complaints and need an efficient way to route them to the appropriate teams or departments for resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The \"Automatic Ticket Classification\" assignment is a valuable exercise that demonstrates the application of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques in solving real-world business challenges related to customer support and complaint management. It showcases how technology can be leveraged to enhance customer service, improve efficiency, and streamline complaint resolution processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an overview and detailed conclusion of our \"**Automatic Ticket Classification**\" assignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Assignment Overview:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"Automatic Ticket Classification\" assignment involved the following key steps and tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Data Preprocessing**:\n",
    "  *  We began by cleaning and preprocessing the dataset containing customer complaints. This included tasks such as text normalization, removal of stopwords, and lemmatization. Additionally, we labeled each complaint with a topic category.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Data Exploration**: You explored the dataset to understand its distribution across different complaint topics. This involved visualizations and statistical analysis to gain insights into the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Text Vectorization**: To prepare the text data for machine learning, we used the Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF Transformer to convert text complaints into numerical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Model Selection**: We selected three different models for classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **Multinomial Naive Bayes**\n",
    "    * **Logistic Regression**\n",
    "    * **Decision Tree**\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Model Building and Evaluation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * We trained each of the selected models on the training data.\n",
    "   * Hyperparameter tuning was performed to find the best parameters for each model.\n",
    "   * The F1 Score, a weighted average of precision and recall, was used as the evaluation metric for model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Model Comparison**: You compared the F1 Scores of the three models to determine which one performed the best on the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Model Saving**: The best-performing model, which was the Logistic Regression model, was saved as a pickle file for future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  **Custom Text Prediction**: Finally, we created a function to predict the topic of a custom text complaint using the saved Logistic Regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Detailed Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Data Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing is a crucial step in natural language processing (NLP) tasks. By cleaning and preprocessing the customer complaints, you ensured that the text data was in a suitable format for machine learning. Text normalization, removal of stopwords, and lemmatization improved the quality of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Model Selection and Training**: We experimented with three different classification models: Multinomial Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree. Each model was trained on the preprocessed training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Hyperparameter tuning helps in finding the best combination of hyperparameters for each model. Grid search with cross-validation was used to optimize hyperparameters, resulting in improved model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Model Evaluation**: To evaluate the models, we used the F1 Score, which balances precision and recall. This metric is particularly useful in cases where class imbalance exists, as it provides a single score that considers both false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Best Model Selection**: The Logistic Regression model outperformed the other models with the highest F1 Score of 0.94 on the test data. This makes it the best model for classifying customer complaints into relevant topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  **Model Saving**: The Logistic Regression model was saved as a pickle file, allowing for easy reusability without the need for retraining.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  **Custom Text Prediction**: A custom text prediction function was created to demonstrate the practical use of the best model. Users can input their complaints, and the model will predict the most relevant topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why Logistic Regression is the Best Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic Regression proved to be the best model for this task for several reasons:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **High F1 Score**: It achieved the highest F1 Score of 0.94, indicating excellent precision and recall on the test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  **Interpretability**: Logistic Regression provides interpretability, making it easier to understand the factors influencing the predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Efficiency**: It is computationally efficient and can handle large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Robustness**: Logistic Regression performed well even with the text data after preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Consistency**: The model provided consistent and reliable predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Overall Benefits:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*  The assignment demonstrated the entire workflow of text classification, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  It showcased the importance of choosing the right evaluation metric, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The custom text prediction function adds practical value, allowing users to classify new complaints into relevant topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "*  The Logistic Regression model, with its high F1 Score, can be deployed in real-world scenarios to automate the classification of customer complaints, improving efficiency and customer service.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*In conclusion, the \"**Automatic Ticket Classification**\" assignment successfully achieved its objectives, and the Logistic Regression model emerged as the best choice for accurately classifying customer complaints into topics. This assignment provides valuable insights into text classification and its practical applications.*\n",
